----

# URL
### Uniform Resource Locator

* Every web site on the world wide web has a unique address!

----

<img class="xl-img" src="https://cascadingmedia.com/assets/images/insites/2015/02/url-anatomy/url-anatomy-55598c24.png">

----

# Exercise

* Take 2 minutes to find a page from at least 2 of your favorite sites on the web.
* Write down the URLs and circle / identify each part
* All 8 parts may not be there...

---

# The Terminal

----

## The Terminal

* The terminal is a way to interact with files your computer.
* It is similar to the "File Explorer" but instead of pointing and clicking on icons, everything is done with text "commands"
* You can:
    * Go in to directories
    * List the files in a directory
    * Create files
    * Open files or programs
    * MUCH MORE!!
* We will use the terminal to manage our files and manage the servers we create
* There are many different types of shells. Today we will use a shell called `bash`

----

## Common Commands

Print the current directory path
```sh
pwd
``` 
List the files in the current directory
```sh
ls
```
Go into a directory
```sh
cd directorynamehere
```
Create a new directory
```sh
mkdir directorynametocreate
```

----

### Exercise

* Open "Git Bash" on your computer
* At the prompt, see what directory you are in: `pwd`
* Create a directory called workspace: `mkdir workspace`
* Go into the workspace directory: `cd workspace`
* Check what directory you are in: `pwd`
* Open a File Explorer window in the current directory: `explorer .`
    * Move this window to the side so you can see the other folders being created
* Create a directory called my-full-stack-app: `mkdir my-full-stack-app`
* List the files / folders in the directory: `ls`
* Go into the directory: `cd my-full-stack-app`
* Create a directory called client: `mkdir client`
* Create a directory called server: `mkdir server`
* List the files / folders in the directory: `ls`
* Open VS Code in the current directory: `code .`
* Use the File Explorer to verify all of the folders you have created.
* When you are done: Help others around you!

---

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zUtLDT6.png" class="lg-img">

----

# VS Code

* A file editor.
    * There are many other editors. VS Code is a popular one.
* We will use VS Code to edit all of the files that will make up our full stack app.

---

## HTML

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/t0c0Mne.png" class="lg-img">

----

## HTML

* Hypertext Markup Language
* HTML is the foundation of the World Wide Web and the foundation for every web page. 
* Every page you view in a web browser is made up of HTML code (and other things...).

----

* HTML describes the structure of a web page
* HTML elements are represented by "tags"
* HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "image" etc.
* Web Browsers do not display the HTML tags directly, but use them to "render" the content of the page

----

### A Heading Tag

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

### A Paragraph Tag

```html
<p>Hello World</p>
```

----

## Tags can be nested to create hierarchy

```html
<div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This is a web page.</p>
</div>
```

----

## Anatomy of a Tag

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DQRrYJN.png" class="med-lg-img">

----

## Exercise:

* Take 2 minutes to find a page from one of your favorite sites on the web.
* Press CTRL+U (in Chrome) while on the web page to open the HTML source code of the page.
* Write down at least 10 different types of tags you see

----

## Exercise:

* Go to VS Code
* In the Explorer on the Left, "right click" the "client" folder and choose "New File"
* Create a file called "index.html"
* Write the following HTML code in the "index.html" file
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Full Stack App</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

----

* `<!DOCTYPE html>` let's the browser know this is an HTML5 document
* The `<html>` tag is the root of the document.
* The `<head>` tag contains information about our page. The content of the `<head>` tag is not actually rendered on the page.
* The `<title>` tag sets the title of the page displayed in the tab
* The `<body>` will contain all of the content of the page.
* Notice that each tag has a corresponding closing tag.

---

# A Local Static File Server

----

# Exercise:

* Open "Git Bash"
* Navigate to the "client" folder: `cd client`
* Start the server in the client directory: `lite-server`
* Google Chrome should automatically open `http://localhost:3000`.
* You should see a blank page with the title of your web page in the tab.
* In VS Code, add an `h1` title to the `body` of your `index.html` file.
* Switch back to Google Chrome and you should see the title!

----

## What just happened?

* lite-server is a static file server running on port `3000` on your computer
* `localhost` means _your_ computer
* When you visit `http://localhost:3000` in the web browser:
    * A GET request is made to the root of static file server
    * The server responds with the `index.html` file
    * The web browser renders the file

---

# CSS

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nm5zIvg.png" class="lg-img">

----

## CSS

* Cascading Style Sheets
* CSS allows us to apply styles to HTML elements on the page.
* CSS can be defined in a separate `.css` file and linked to an HTML page.

```html
<head>
    <title>My Full Stack App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

----

* CSS is made up style rules
* A rule has a "selector"
    * Which element(s) on the page should have these styles
* A rule has many "declarations"
    * A declaration has a "property" and a "value"
* There are many CSS properties that can be changed!
    * Some common ones include: font-family, color, text-align, margin, padding, width, height

```css
body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}
h1 {
    color: dodgerblue;
    text-align: center;
}
```

----

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/exVKoTm.png" >

----

# Exercise:

* Go to VS Code
* In the Explorer on the Left, "right click" the "client" folder and choose "New File"
* Create a file called "styles.css"
* Add a style rule to select the `body` tag and change the `font-family` to be `sans-serif`
* Add a style rule to select the `h1` tag and change the `color` to be your favorite color and the `text-align` to be `center`
* Open "index.html", in the `head` element add a link to the css file.
* Go back to `http://localhost:3000` and the styles should be applied!
```html
<head>
    <title>My Full Stack App</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

---

# User Input

----

## HTML Forms

* HTML Forms allow us to take in user input!
* The `<form>` tag contains the form elements
* The `<label>` tag describes an input
* The `<input>` and `<textarea>` tags allow users to type their input
* The `<button>` tag allows the user to submit the contents of a form

----

# Exercise:

* Add the following HTML to the body of your "index.html" file

```html
<form>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input name="name" id="name">
    <label for="content">Content:</label>
    <textarea name="content" id="content" rows="3"></textarea>
    <button>Send</button>
</form>
```

----

# Exercise:

* Add the following CSS to the `styles.css` file:

```css
form {
    width: 50%;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
label {
    margin: 1rem;
}
input, textarea, button {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    margin: 1rem;
}
```

---

# JavaScript

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/PiLET1i.png" class="lg-img">

----

* JavaScript is a general purpose programming language
* JavaScript is NOT Java
    * JavaScript is to Java as Ham is to Hamburger
* It is the _only_ programming language the Web Browser understands (besides HTML and CSS)
* JavaScript in the web browser allows us to make web pages interactive
* We will use JavaScript to collect the user input from the form and send it to a server
* JavaScript can be defined in a separate `js` file and linked to an HTML page.

----

### Exercise - create a javascript file

* Go to VS Code
* In the Explorer on the Left, "right click" the "client" folder and choose "New File"
* Create a file called "client.js"
* Inside of the file, write: `alert('hello world!');`
* Open "index.html", at the bottom of the `body` element add a link to the js file.
* Go back to `http://localhost:3000` and you should see a message!

```html
<body>
    <!-- other html here -->
    <!-- This should be at the bottom! -->
    <script src="client.js"></script>
</body>
```

----

## Output messages to the console

* We can use JavaScript to output messages to the developer console
* `console.log` is built in to the web browser to help us debug our code

### Exercise - log to the console

* Remove `alert('hello world')` from your `client.js` file and add the following code: 

```js
console.log('hello world!');
```

----

## Chrome Developer Tools

* Right click the web page and choose "Inspect Element"
* This will open the Chrome Developer Tools
* Select the "Console" tab
* You should see "hello world!" in the console

----

## Selecting Elements

* We can use JavaScript to select elements on the page and make them interactive
* `document.querySelector` is built in to the web browser. We can use any valid CSS selector to select an element with JavaScript.

#### Exercise - select elements

* Select the form on the page and log it:

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');
console.log(form);
```

* If you hover over the logged `form`, it should highlight on the page!

----

## Listening for Events

* We can use JavaScript to listen for when the form is submitted, and then do something with the data in the form

#### Exercise - listen for the submit event

* Create a `function` called `formSubmitted`
* Add a `console.log` inside the function
* Add an event listener to the form `submit` event and pass in the `formSubmitted` function
* Try submitting the form on the page. What happens?

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');
function formSubmitted() {
    console.log('the form was submitted!');
}
form.addEventListener('submit', formSubmitted);
```

----

## Preventing the Default Action

* By default, when a form is submitted, the web browser tries to send the data to itself, and the page refreshes
* We want to prevent that so JavaScript can take control 

### Exercise - prevent the default action

* Add an `event` parameter to the `formSubmitted` function
* Inside the function, prevent the default action.
* Now, you should see the console.log!

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');
function formSubmitted(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('the form was submitted!');
}
form.addEventListener('submit', formSubmitted);
```

----

## Collecting Form Data

* We can use the `FormData` object to collect the user input from the form.

```js
const formData = new FormData(form);
```

* `formData.get` allows us to specify the name of an input or textarea to retrieve the contents

```js
const name = formData.get('name');
console.log(name);
```

----

#### Exercise - collect user input with FormData

* Inside the formSubmitted function, create a formData object.
* Get the name and content and store them in variables.
* Log the name and content variables to the console.
* Try submitting the form with different inputs to see what happens.

```js
const form = document.querySelector('form');
function formSubmitted(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log('the form was submitted!');
    const formData = new FormData(form);
    const name = formData.get('name');
    console.log(name);
    const content = formData.get('content');
    console.log(content);
}
form.addEventListener('submit', formSubmitted);
```

----

## Hiding and Showing Elements

* We want to show a loading image whenever the user submits the form
* We can hide / show the image with JavaScript!
* The `style` property of any element can be used to apply CSS styles _with_ JavaScript!

----

### Exercise - add a loading image

* Add a loading image to the `index.html` file below the form

```html
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/nr8xNVI.gif">
```

* Add the following CSS to `styles.css` to center the image:

```css
img {
    display: block;
    margin: 1rem auto;
    width: 50%;
}
```

* In the `client.js` file, select the image and hide it:

```js
const loadingImage = document.querySelector('img');
loadingImage.style.display = 'none';
```

----

### Exercise - hide / show elements

* Hide the form and show the loading image when the form is submitted!
* This creates a good user experience, as the user can see that "something" is happening with their input.
* Inside the `formSubmitted` function, add the following code:

```js
form.style.display = 'none'; // hide the form
loadingImage.style.display = 'block'; // show the image
```

* The form should disappear and the image should appear when the form is submitted!

----

* We'll come back to the client in a bit.
* Now, let's work on the server!

---

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kur8fBb.png" class="lg-img">

----

## Node.js

* Node.js is a server side runtime for JavaScript
* This allows us to create back-end / server applications with JavaScript!
* The code we write on the server is very different from the client, but the "syntax" is the same

----

## Exercise - interactive node REPL

* Open "Git Bash"
* Run the node command: `node`
* You now have a JavaScript REPL (Read Eval Print Loop)
* Type: `console.log('hello from node')` and press enter
* Type: `.exit` to quit the REPL

----

## NPM

* NPM is a package manager for Node.js
* We can use it to install libraries / packages from the NPM registry: https://www.npmjs.com/

----

## Exercise - initialize a package.json

* Open "Git Bash"
* Change to the `workspace/my-full-stack-app/server` directory.
* Initialize the project: `npm init`
* Answer the questions
* List the files in the directory: `ls`
* You should see the `package.json` file that was created

----

## Dependencies

* We will use some existing libraries to help us build the back-end server
* These dependencies are installed with npm
    * nodemon - a tool to automatically restart the server when changes are detected
    * express - a library for creating APIs
    * cors - an express middleware that adds CORS headers
    * morgan - an express middleware logger
    * nedb-promises - a simple database library

----

## Exercise - install dependencies

* Open "Git Bash"
* Change to the `workspace/my-full-stack-app/server` directory.
* Install dependencies with npm:

```sh
npm install nodemon express cors morgan nedb-promises
```

* Open the `package.json` file in VS Code. You should now see all of these dependencies listed

----

### Exercise - create a server.js file

* Go to VS Code
* In the Explorer on the Left, "right click" the "server" folder and choose "New File"
* Create a file called "server.js"
* Write the following JavaScript code in the "server.js" file:

```js
console.log('hello from node!');
```

* Run the file in the terminal:

```sh
node server.js
```

* You should see `hello from node!` logged to the terminal.

----

### Exercise - add scripts to package.json

* Open the `package.json` file in VS Code.
* Add the following scripts to the `scripts` section:

```json
"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js"
}
```

* Open "Git Bash"
* Change to the `workspace/my-full-stack-app/server` directory.
* Run the command: `npm start`
* You should see `hello from node!` logged to the terminal.

----

### Exercise - Create an express server

* Update the `server.js` file to include the following code:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.json({
        message: 'Hello from Node.js'
    });
});

app.listen(5000, () => {
    console.log('Server is listening on port 5000!');
});
```

* Run the command: `npm run dev`
* You should see the message in the console.
* Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser
* Make a GET request with postman to this address

----

### Back to the diagram

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/media-p.slid.es/uploads/167545/images/1646308/the-web-simple.png">

----

### Exercise - Add express middlewares

* Update the top of `server.js` to include:

```js
const express = require('express');
const morgan = require('morgan');
const cors = require('cors');

const app = express();
app.use(morgan('common'));
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
```

----

## HTTP Requests

* Up until now, we have only made GET requests
    * A GET request typically _just_ requests a page or data
* A POST request allows the server to _receive_ data
* There are many other HTTP methods including: GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS

----

### Exercise - Add a post route

* In `server.js` add a post route below the middlewares:

```js
app.post('/create', (req, res) => {
    res.json(req.body);
});
```

* In postman make POST request to `http://localhost:5000/create` with the following body content:

```json
{
	"name": "Your name here",
	"content": "Your content here"
}
```

----

* In postman select: body -> raw -> choose json from the dropdown

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/elyn9WJ.png" class="lg-img">

* You should see the same body in the response!

---

# Databases!


<img src="https://img.stackshare.io/service/5859/ne.jpg" class="med-img">

----

## Databases

* Databases are used for _persistent_ storage
* There are many different kinds of databases
* NOSQL and SQL are common database types
* We will store all of our messages in a database called `nedb-promises`!
* This way, no matter when / where we visit the web site, the server will always have all the latest messages that can be served to the client

----

### Exercise - setup the database

* In the `server.js` file at the top, add the following code:

```js
const nedb = require('nedb-promises')
const db = nedb.create('data.db');
```

----

### Exercise - Insert data into the database

* Update the post route to insert the request body into the database

```js
app.post('/create', async (req, res) => {
    const inserted = await db.insert(req.body);
    res.json(inserted);
});
```

* Make a POST request in postman again. This time you should see an _id in the response!

----


### Exercise - Validate the data before inserting

* Update the post route to validate the request body before inserting:

```js
app.post('/create', async (req, res) => {
    if (req.body.name
        && req.body.name.toString() !== ''
        && req.body.content
        && req.body.content.toString() !== '') {
        const inserted = await db.insert({
            name: req.body.name.toString(),
            content: req.body.content.toString()
        });
        res.json(inserted);
    } else {
        res.status(500);
        res.json({
            message: 'Name and content cannot be empty!'
        });
    }
});
```

* Make a POST request in postman again. This time you should see an _id in the response!
* Try making a POST request with no name or content. You should see the error!

----

## Exercise - List the messages in the database

* Create a new GET route with the following code:

```js
app.get('/list', async (req, res) => {
    const messages = await db.find();
    res.json(messages);
});

* Make a GET request in Postman to `http://localhost:5000/list`
* Also try visiting `http://localhost:5000/list` in the web browser. Does this work? If so, Why?
```

---

# Back to the diagram

---

# Make requests with fetch + JavaScript in the Browser

----

* Similar to how we can make requests to the server with postman, we can make requests to the server with JavaScript!
* `fetch` is built in to the web browser and allows us to make requests with JavaScript.

----

## Exercise - Make a POST request with JavaScript

* In the `client.js` file, add the `async` keyword in front of the word function of the `formSubmitted` function, and add the following code at the end:

```js
async function formSubmitted(event) {
    // lots of codes here
    const message = {
        name,
        content
    };
    const url = 'http://localhost:5000/create';
    const response = await fetch(url, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
            'content-type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(message),
    });
    const json = await response.json();
    console.log(json);
}
```

----

* Try entering and submitting a message on the page.
* You should see the data logged to the console.

----

## Exercise - Show the form / hide the image

* After a successful submission, it makes sense to hide the loading image and show the form again.
* At the end of the `formSubmitted` function add the following code:

```js
form.style.display = 'block'; // show the form
loadingImage.style.display = 'none'; // show the image
```

----

### Exercise - Create a place in the HTML to list the messages

* In the `index.html` file, below the form, create a div with the `id` messages:

```html
<div id="messages"></div>
```

----

### Exercise - Select an element by ID with JavaScript

* In the `client.js` file, at the top, select the messages div and store it in a variable called messagesElement:

```js
const messagesElement = document.querySelector('#messages');
```

* We will use this variable in the next exercise to list the messages on the page.

----

### Exercise - List all of the messages on the page

* In the `client.js` file, add the following function:

```js
async function listMessages() {
    messagesElement.innerHTML = ''; // Clear the existing messages
    loadingImage.style.display = 'block'; // show the loading image
    const url = 'http://localhost:5000/list';
    const response = await fetch(url);
    const messages = await response.json();
    for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
        const message = messages[i];
        const messageDiv = document.createElement('div');

        const nameElement = document.createElement('h3');
        nameElement.textContent = message.name;
        messageDiv.appendChild(nameElement);

        const contentElement = document.createElement('p');
        contentElement.textContent = message.content;

### Exercise - Call the listMessages function

* At the bottom of the `client.js` file, call the `listMessages` function:

```js
listMessages();
```

* Now when the page loads, you should see all of the messages on the page!

----

### Exercise - Style the messages

* Add the following CSS to the `styles.css` file to center the messages:

```css
#messages {
    display: block;
    margin: 1rem auto;
    width: 50%;
}
```

----

### Exercise - List the messages after creating a new message

* At the end of the `formSubmitted` function, call the `listMessages` function:

```js
async function formSubmitted(event) {
    // lots of codes here
    listMessages();
}
```

* Now, after the form is submitted, you should see the new message on the page!
